# clj-majorclust

A Clojure library designed to play with the [major clust algorithm](http://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/webis/teaching/lecturenotes/machine-learning/unit-en-cluster-analysis-density.pdf) and [loom](https://github.com/aysylu/loom) .
## Usage

actually don't use this ;-)

        lein deps

Have a look add the very simple tests. I have been downloading some sample cluster data sets [here](http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/) to how
majorclust is performing. To be able to do simple vector comparison in the euklidian space,
I have taken a look at [infer](https://github.com/sojoner/infer.git) forked it and use some
measurements in the similarity namespace.
